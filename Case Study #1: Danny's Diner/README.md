# Case Study #1 Danny's Diner


![week 1](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/images/case-study-designs/1.png)

## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns,
how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## case study question 
*What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
*How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
*What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
*What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
*Which item was the most popular for each customer?
*Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
*Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
*What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
*If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
*In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
