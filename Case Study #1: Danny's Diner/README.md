## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns,
how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
